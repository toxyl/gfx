# Blend Modes
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| add | Adds the pixel values of the blend layer to the base, brightening the image. It's ideal for simulating light effects such as glows or flares. |
| average | Computes the average of the pixel values from both layers, resulting in a smooth, balanced blend. This mode works well for subtle transitions. |
| color | Replaces the hue and saturation of the base image with those of the blend layer while keeping luminance unchanged. It's perfect for recoloring images without affecting detail. |
| color-burn | Darkens the base by increasing contrast with the blend, deepening shadows and enriching tones. Often used for dramatic, high-contrast effects. |
| color-dodge | Brightens the base image by reducing contrast relative to the blend, enhancing highlights and creating a luminous effect. |
| contrast-negate | Inverts the relative contrast of the image, flipping light and dark areas for a striking, surreal look. This creative mode is great for experimental effects. |
| darken | Compares pixel values and retains the darker one, emphasizing shadows and creating a moody, deeper composite. |
| darker-color | Selects the pixel with the lower overall color intensity, favoring more saturated dark hues and enhancing color depth in shadowed areas. |
| difference | Subtracts one layer's pixel values from the other to produce a high-contrast, sometimes inverted effect. It's often used for edgy, creative visuals. |
| divide | Divides the base pixel values by those of the blend, producing a lighter, sometimes ethereal result. It can generate unique, abstract effects. |
| erase | Reduces the opacity of the base image where the blend is applied, effectively “erasing” parts of the image. Commonly used for masking or creating transparency. |
| exclusion | Creates a softer variant of the difference mode, lowering extreme contrasts for a more subtle, muted effect. |
| glow | Enhances brightness around lighter areas to produce a soft, halo-like effect. This mode is useful for adding a natural or artistic glow. |
| hard-light | Combines aspects of multiply and screen modes based on the blend color, resulting in high contrast with dynamic lighting—ideal for dramatic overlays. |
| hard-mix | Applies a threshold effect that produces a highly posterized, almost binary color output, perfect for bold, graphic designs. |
| hue | Replaces the base image’s hue with that of the blend layer while preserving luminance and saturation, making it great for targeted color shifts. |
| lighten | Compares pixels and selects the lighter value, brightening the image overall. It's often used to emphasize highlights. |
| lighter-color | Similar to lighten but evaluates the overall color brightness rather than just luminance, favoring more vibrant tones. |
| linear-burn | Darkens the image in a linear fashion, gently reducing brightness while preserving detail—a controlled way to deepen shadows. |
| linear-light | Adjusts brightness linearly by combining elements of dodge and burn, offering a versatile method for fine-tuning contrast and exposure. |
| luminosity | Replaces the base image’s luminance with that of the blend while keeping hue and saturation intact, useful for brightness adjustments without color shifts. |
| multiply | Multiplies the pixel values to darken the image, enhancing shadows and adding depth. It's a standard choice for shading and weight. |
| negation | Inverts pixel values by subtracting them from a maximum, producing a high-contrast negative effect. This mode is often used for dramatic, artistic looks. |
| normal | Applies no special blending—simply overlays the blend layer as is. It's the default mode for straightforward layer stacking. |
| overlay | Merges multiply and screen techniques; dark areas become darker and light areas become lighter, boosting contrast and texture. |
| pin-light | Selectively replaces pixels based on brightness thresholds, creating a posterized, high-contrast effect that emphasizes extremes. |
| reflect | Inverts the base color relative to the blend, simulating a mirror-like, reflective effect that can highlight edges or add luminosity. |
| saturation | Transfers only the saturation from the blend to the base while leaving hue and luminance unchanged—ideal for adjusting color intensity. |
| screen | Inverts, multiplies, and then reinverts pixels to produce a brighter, washed-out effect. It's commonly used to add soft highlights. |
| soft-light | Applies a gentle, diffused light effect that subtly darkens or lightens the base image, enhancing textures without harsh contrasts. |
| subtract | Subtracts the blend from the base, often resulting in a darker, more textured image. It's useful for creating moody, vintage-style effects. |
| vivid-light | Combines elements of color dodge and color burn to produce a highly saturated, high-contrast image. This mode is excellent for dramatic and vibrant enhancements. |
